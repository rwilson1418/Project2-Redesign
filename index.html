      <h2>  Revel Grove, Oxfordshire, England</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The year is 1534. King Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn in 1533 and they welcomed a baby daughter, Elizabeth.

Sadly, the Queen's most recent pregnancy has ended in a miscarriage. While disappointed, Henry is still confident Anne will give him a son. The King is on the annual royal progress, and he and the courtiers visit the village of Revel Grove to enjoy the Harvest Festival.  The King seems in high spirits, as his eye has once again wandered. He is smitten with a lady known to history only as 'the Imperial lady'.

Factions in the court unfriendly to the Queen and the Boleyn family have noticed that Anne has not joined the King on this visit. Are there finally cracks in the royal marriage? Could enemies to the queen use this to their advantage?  Intrigue abounds!

In the village, Mayor Richard Mondes has become Sir Richard Mondes, which thrills his social climbing heart!  His wife the Baroness Marney, has given birth to twins, Edward and Katherine.  Life is definitely good for the mayor and his family.

All of the villagers of Revel Grove are on hand to welcome the King, court, and our gracious guests to a fabulous day of feasting and fun!</p>
